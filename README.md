1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your team.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

#### First stretch goal

to generate a new project with the tabs-template to look at a working example
of tab-navigation.
